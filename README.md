# sales-trend-analysis
Performed sales data analysis using SQL. Extracted insights on revenue, top products, customer behavior, and sales trends. Used CTEs and subqueries for advanced metrics like YoY growth. Visualized findings using Excel charts.
# Sales Data Analysis Using SQL

This repository contains an end-to-end SQL analysis project performed on a retail sales dataset sourced from Kaggle. The objective of this project is to derive meaningful business insights by writing and executing structured SQL queries on various aspects of the dataset such as customer behavior, sales performance, product trends, and time-based revenue analysis.

---

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **SQL (MySQL)**
- **Microsoft Excel** (for data visualization)
- **Kaggle Sales Dataset**

---

## Objectives

The key goals of this project include:

- Understanding overall sales performance
- Analyzing monthly and yearly revenue trends
- Identifying top-performing products and categories
- Segmenting customer behavior by age and gender
- Calculating average transaction value and total revenue
- Implementing Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for advanced insights

---

## SQL Concepts Demonstrated

- Data retrieval using `SELECT` and `WHERE`
- Aggregation using `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`
- Grouping with `GROUP BY` and filtering with `HAVING`
- Sorting using `ORDER BY`
- Date functions for time-based analysis
- Use of subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Percentage calculations and ranking logic

---

## Project Structure

- `sales_analysis.sql` – Contains all SQL queries with structured sections and descriptive headings.
- `README.md` – Documentation of the project (this file).
- `visuals/` – Folder containing visualizations created in Excel (optional).
- `sales_dataset.csv` – Dataset used for analysis (if allowed to share based on license).

---

## Sample Insights Derived

- Total and average revenue per transaction
- Monthly and yearly sales trends
- Top 5 best-selling products by revenue
- Sales distribution by customer gender and age group
- Revenue contribution by each product category
- Year-over-year revenue growth
- Region-wise and state-wise performance

---

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local system.
2. Load the dataset into a SQL database.
3. Execute the queries from the `sales_analysis.sql` file.
4. Optionally, view Excel visualizations (if included) to complement the SQL insights.

## Project Status

The analysis is complete and well-documented. Future enhancements could include:

- Integration with Power BI or Tableau for dashboards
- Automation of data ingestion and reporting
- Expansion to include more advanced SQL queries
